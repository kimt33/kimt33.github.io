Hi there! My name is David. I am a PhD student in Chemistry and Physics that decided to leave
academia about 2 years from graduation. I am now scrambling to figure out what I need to do to
get a job outside of academia, especially in fields that are not directly related to my study
(theoretical chemistry/physics). I've been told that having a blog helps showcase my skills and
knowledge. This website will serve as a repository of things that I did, that I know, and of
things I that I think are neat.
