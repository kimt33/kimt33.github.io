The goal for this website is to store my notes and projects so that I can display them in an
accessible manner. For the most part, I will try to write with an audience in mind, but it's
possible that I forget about the audience and present the content as is, especially for some of the
derivations and equations. Hopefully these materials help me remember and help others learn new
things. 

There are some features that I would like this website to have:
1. Support different file formats
2. Use github features inside

This website is generated using Jackyll and hosted by GitHub Pages. I've thought of making the site
from ground up without Jackyll, but at the moment this seems to be too much work. Since my notes are
often in different file formats (`.org` and `.tex` mostly), it would be nice if multiple formats are
supported. 

Since notes change organically, it would be great to be able to use the full features of the github.
For example, I would like to modify existing posts without having to write addendums. Since the
posts are already associated with a git repository, the history of a file should also be available
without too much effort. It would also be neat to utilize the GitHub's Issue and Pull Request system
for discussions and  user submitted corrections.
